# Frillios-Pizza
Web Design Project by Parker Thornton

This was a Web Design project I made for school. The assignment was to create a Pizza website with a home, menu, and contact page (additional information may be found on the official student website: http://www.frillios-pizza.com/). 

All of the code in the project was written from scratch using the AngularJS library, therefore, in order to run/view the website, it must be ran on a server using HTTP.
